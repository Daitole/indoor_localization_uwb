3. step2_trilateration.py - A python script to perform localization for both participants and all the patterns using trilateration method.

4. localization_plots/ - A folder with all plots from step2_trilateration.py. It contains plots for all patterns from both the participants

5. step3_step4_vitalSign.py - A python script to draw the raw breathing wave forms for both participants and all different postures for all radars. It also estimates the breathing rate for each posture.

6. vital_sign_plots/ - A folder with all plots from step3_step4_vitalSign.py. It contains plots for all postures from both the participants and for all radars

7. Report.txt - A report comprising of all results.
